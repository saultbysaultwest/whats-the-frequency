# What's the Frequency

This is a simple ear training app. It plays a random sine wave, then offers you a few different choices to guess which frequency it is.
On the backend, an integration with MongoDB Atlas via Vercel Serverless Functions gives us a Challenge Mode with a leaderboard.

Take a shot, see if you can beat the top score!
